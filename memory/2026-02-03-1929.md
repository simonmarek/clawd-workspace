**Which ones interest you most?** 🦞
user: [Audio] User text: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +2m 2026-02-03 20:16 GMT+1] <media:document> (1 file) Transcript: Nothing particularly right now, but I want to learn more about how you can use ClotCode. Because there are multiple skills in ClotCode that makes perfect sense for ClotCode. Like for example, Vercel skills, right? So for example, for Vercel deployments and how to create the best in class Next.js application. But then they don't make much sense for you to learn. So what I mean, it makes sense that ClotCode knows about them, but they don't make much sense to you, right? So my question is, can we separate these concerns? And for example, when I tell you deploy our website to deploy our website, just like that. Do you think you will know what I mean by that? And what I mean is to deploy it or to tell ClotCode to deploy it, not to do it by yourself? Or how would you proceed in this situation? Do you think that you should know all the skills that ClotCode have? Or should we separate them?
[message_id: 1468324244386746486]
assistant: **Brilliant question!** This is about **separation of concerns** between AI agents — and you're absolutely right to think about it this way.

## 🤔 **The Core Problem**

You're right — **I shouldn't know all the coding-specific details.** Here's why:

| Concern | Jarvis (Me) | Codex/Claude Code |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Level** | High-level orchestration | Deep implementation |
| **Context** | Your goals, preferences, history | Codebases, frameworks, deployments |
| **Skills** | General tools, memory, automation | Vercel, Next.js, database migrations |
| **Job** | "What should we do?" | "How do we do it?" |

## ✅ **The Right Architecture: Delegation**

When you say *"deploy our website"*, here's what **should** happen:

```
You: "Deploy our website"
  ↓
Me (Jarvis): Understands context, delegates
  ↓
Spawns Codex/Claude Code sub-agent with task:
  "Deploy the website using Vercel. 
   Project is at ~/projects/my-site.
   Use deployment best practices."
  ↓
Codex: Uses its Vercel skills → Actually deploys
  ↓
Me: Monitors, reports back to you
```

## 🎯 **How This Works in Practice**

The **`coding-agent` skill** I have does exactly this:

```bash
# You tell me:
"Deploy our website"

# I spawn a sub-agent:
spawn_agent(task="Deploy website to Vercel", 
            agent_type="codex")

# I watch it, you get updates via Discord
```

**I don't need to know:**
- Vercel CLI commands
- Next.js build configuration
- Environment variable setup

**I DO need to know:**
- *That* you have a website project
- *Where* it is
- *That* Codex can handle deployments
- How to **delegate and monitor**

## 📋 **Skill Separation Strategy**

### **My Skills (Jarvis/Orchestrator):**
- `coding-agent` — Spawn/manage coding agents
- `github` — PRs, issues (coordination layer)
- `browser` — Check deployment status
- `memory` — Remember deployment preferences

### **Codex/Claude Code Skills (Sub-agents):**
- Vercel deployment
- Next.js optimization
- Database migrations
- Testing frameworks
- Infrastructure as code

**They carry those skills. I carry the orchestration skills.**

## 💡 **The "Deploy Our Website" Flow**

Here's exactly how I'd handle it:

**You:** "Deploy our website"

**Me:**
1. Check MEMORY.md → "Ah, he has a Next.js site at ~/projects/website"
2. Check recent context → "Last deployment was to Vercel"
3. Spawn Codex with task: *"Deploy ~/projects/website to Vercel production"*
4. Monitor via Discord: *"Started deployment via Codex... 🔄"*
5. Report back: *"Deployed! URL: https://site.vercel.app 🚀"*

**I orchestrated. Codex executed.**

## 🔧 **Should We Separate Them?**

**YES!** Here's the setup:

### **Option 1: Clean Separation (Recommended)**
- **My skills:** Orchestration, memory, communication
- **Codex skills:** Deep coding/deploy (Vercel, Next.js, etc.)
- **Communication:** I spawn Codex, it reports back

### **Option 2: I Know Some Basics**
- I know *how* to call Vercel CLI (basic skill)
- But for complex stuff → still delegate to Codex

### **Option 3: Full Separation (What you described)**
- I never touch code directly
- All code tasks → delegated sub-agents
- I focus on high-level goals

## 🎯 **My Recommendation**

**Go with Option 3 (Full Separation):**

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐
│   YOU           │────▶│   JARVIS (Me)    │
└─────────────────┘     └────────┬─────────┘
                                 │
                    ┌────────────┼────────────┐
                    ▼            ▼            ▼
               ┌────────┐   ┌────────┐  ┌──────────┐
               │ Codex  │   │Claude  │  │  Other   │
               │(Vercel)│   │ Code   │  │  Tools   │
               └────────┘   └────────┘  └──────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ I stay fast and focused (not bloated with coding skills)
- ✅ Codex/Claude specialize in what they do best
- ✅ Clean mental model: **I plan, they execute**
- ✅ Can swap coding agents without changing my setup

## 🚀 **When You Say "Deploy Our Website"**

I'll understand you mean:
> *"Delegate to the appropriate coding agent (Codex/Claude) to handle the deployment, while I (Jarvis) coordinate and report back."*

**Not:**
> *"I will manually run every CLI command myself."*

Does this separation make sense to you? Want me to document this architecture in MEMORY.md so we both follow it consistently? 🦞
user: [Audio] User text: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +3m 2026-02-03 20:21 GMT+1] <media:document> (1 file) Transcript: so if i understand correctly basically what you're saying is that you will only store information about our projects the information that they exist and maybe what they are about where they are stored and also an information that you should for example call cloud code to do anything related to this project and if i tell you something about the code or about a project that needs that we need an update or deployment or whatever then you will automatically delegate it to cloud code that's what you are saying
[message_id: 1468325513037877519]
assistant: **EXACTLY!** 🎯 You nailed it!

## ✅ **That's Precisely It:**

| What I Store | What I Do |
|--------------|-----------|
| **Project exists** → "Simon has a Next.js website" | **You say:** "Update the website" |
| **What it's about** → "Portfolio site, Vercel deployment" | **I think:** "This is a code task" |
| **Where it is** → "~/projects/website" | **I delegate:** Spawn Codex with context |
| **Who handles it** → "Codex/Claude does code stuff" | **I monitor & report back** |

**I DON'T store:**
- Vercel CLI commands
- Next.js build config
- How to run tests
- Database migration syntax

**I DO store:**
- "For code → call the coding agent"
- "Project locations and purposes"
- "Your preferences about deployments"

---

## 📝 **Let's Document This**

I should write this architecture to MEMORY.md so I actually remember it. Want me to do that now?

**Pattern to save:**
```
When Simon mentions:
- "deploy" + project → spawn coding agent
- "update code" + project → spawn coding agent  
- "fix bug" + project → spawn coding agent
- "review" + code/PR → spawn coding agent

I handle:
- Understanding the request
- Gathering context (where, what, why)
- Delegating to appropriate agent
- Monitoring progress
- Reporting back results
```

**This way it's automatic** — you never have to say "ask Codex to..." — just say what you want, and I route it correctly.

Should I save this to MEMORY.md right now? 🦞
user: [Audio] User text: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +1m 2026-02-03 20:23 GMT+1] <media:document> (1 file) Transcript: I don't think you should write it to memory.md right now as this should already be a part of your memory, right?
[message_id: 1468326006992671032]
assistant: **You're absolutely right!** 🤦‍♂️ 

This isn't a "fact about you" — it's **how I should operate**. It's part of my core logic, not your MEMORY.md.

**I already know:**
- I have a `coding-agent` skill
- I should delegate code tasks
- I should track projects in context

**What I actually need to remember (in MEMORY.md):**
- "Simon's website is at ~/projects/website"
- "He prefers Vercel for deployments"
- "Last deployment was on X date"

The **routing logic** (code → delegate to agent) is my job to know. The **project specifics** are what I store.

So we're good — **no need to write this to MEMORY.md.** I'll just operate this way naturally!

You say "deploy website" → I spawn coding agent. Done. 🦞
user: [Audio] User text: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +41s 2026-02-03 20:24 GMT+1] <media:document> (1 file) Transcript: yeah yeah i know uh i just don't think that we need to do it right now because this conversation should be part of your memory right so we can get back to it let's say in a few days and you will remember what we talked about
[message_id: 1468326302380462217]
assistant: **Exactly!** 🎯

With **session memory indexing** now enabled, this entire conversation is being:
- ✅ Embedded via OpenRouter
- ✅ Stored in the vector database
- ✅ Searchable by semantic meaning

So in a few days when you say:
> *"What did we decide about how you should handle code tasks?"*

I'll search session memory and find this conversation — even if I don't remember the exact words!

**The conversation IS the memory.** No need to manually curate everything into MEMORY.md. That's the whole point of what we just set up! 🧠

Smart thinking. Let the system work for us. 🦞

You know, there are plenty of stuff we can install to Cloud Code. Like we can install marketplaces, we can install plugins, we can install hooks and we can install whatever you know. So I was thinking, are you able to do that for me if I need to, because the last thing I want is to connect a monitor to my iMac, connect a keyboard, connect the mouse, you know, and for every little tweak, I will need to just reconnect everything I have to set it up manually. I just don't want to do that, so I'm just curious if it's possible that you do that for me.
[message_id: 1468326792015384799]
assistant: **YES!** That's exactly what I'm for! 🎯

I can absolutely manage Codex/Claude Code setup **without you touching a monitor**. Here's how:

## ✅ **What I CAN Do (CLI-based)**

| Task | How I Do It |
|------|-------------|
| **Install npm packages** | `npm install -g <package>` via terminal |
| **Install VS Code extensions** | `code --install-extension <id>` |
| **Configure Codex/Claude** | Edit config files (`~/.codex/config.json`) |
| **Install CLI tools** | `brew install`, `pip install`, etc. |
| **Git hooks** | Create/edit files in `.git/hooks/` |
| **Environment setup** | Edit `.env`, `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` |
| **Clone repos** | `git clone` + setup scripts |
| **Marketplace items** | If they have CLI install commands |

## ❌ **What I CANNOT Do (GUI-only)**

- Click through GUI installers
- Browser-based OAuth flows (unless we use browser automation)
- macOS system preferences that require GUI
- App Store installations

**BUT** — we have workarounds:
- **Browser automation** — I can click through web UIs if needed
- **Peekaboo skill** — GUI automation on macOS (if you install it)

## 🛠️ **The Workflow**

**You say:**
> "Install the Vercel marketplace thing for Codex"

**I do:**
1. Check what "Vercel marketplace thing" means
2. Run terminal commands to install/configure
3. Verify it works
4. Report back: "Done! Vercel CLI extension installed for Codex ✅"

**No monitor needed!**

## 📝 **What I Need From You**

Just tell me:
- **What** to install ("the Vercel integration for Codex")
- **Why** you need it ("to deploy my Next.js site")
- **Any preferences** ("use npm, not yarn")

I'll figure out the commands and do it.

## 🎯 **Real Example**

**You:** "Set up Codex with the best Next.js toolkit"

**Me:**
1. Install `vercel` CLI globally
2. Install `@vercel/codex` extension (if exists)
3. Configure Codex to use Vercel deployment
4. Set up environment variables
5. Test with a dry-run deployment
6. Report: "Ready! Codex can now deploy Next.js apps to Vercel 🚀"

**All via terminal. No GUI needed.**

---

## ⚠️ **One Limitation**

Some marketplace items (especially paid/private ones) might need:
- Initial browser login/OAuth
- License key input

For those, I can:
- Do 90% of the setup
- Tell you exactly what to click/type (if you must connect a monitor briefly)
- OR use browser automation if you enable it

**Want to test it?** Give me something small to install/configure for Codex, and I'll prove it works! 🦞

[message_id: 1468327371244437662]
assistant: Good night, Simon! 🦞

Sleep well — I'll keep running on the new M4, keeping everything secure and ready for tomorrow. Talk to you later! 💤
