assistant: Hey there! 🤖 Jarvis here — back online and ready to roll. What's on the agenda today?
user: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +30s 2026-02-04 16:53 GMT+1] Hey Jarvis, can you check if we have shadcn installed in our simonmarek.cz project?
[message_id: 1468635609307283486]
assistant: Yes! shadcn/ui is installed and configured. I can see the `components.json` with the schema and all the typical dependencies in place — `class-variance-authority`, `tailwind-merge`, `lucide-react`, and `radix-ui`. It's set up with the "new-york" style and Tailwind v4.
user: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +2m 2026-02-04 16:56 GMT+1] Aight cool, can you setup the Tailark Veil theme config and registry for tailark? https://tailark.com/docs https://github.com/tailark/blocks/blob/main/packages/veil-kit/README.md
[message_id: 1468636346443894815]
assistant: The globals.css already has the Veil theme colors! I just need to add the Tailark registry to `components.json`:
assistant: Done! The Tailark registry is now configured. You can install Veil blocks using:

```bash
npx shadcn add @tailark/veil
```

Or install specific blocks like:
```bash
npx shadcn add @tailark/veil/hero
```

The theme CSS variables were already set up in globals.css with the warm, earthy Veil palette. You're good to go! 🎨
