## Conversation Summary

assistant: Hey Simon! Jarvis here — ready to dive into whatever you've got cooking. What's on the agenda today?
user: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +2d 2026-02-07 11:42 GMT+1] Yoo Jarvis good day to you
[message_id: 1469644447678726196]
assistant: Hey! Good day to you too, Simon. ☀️ What's up?
user: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +17s 2026-02-07 11:42 GMT+1] I am going to create that bad boy new website of mine, you remember when we talked about it?
[message_id: 1469644538669699317]
assistant: Yeah, I remember — we're talking about that multi-page site for your Czech-speaking clients: homepage, services, contact, blog. You wanted to move away from the single-pager to something warmer and more credible with that "Veil" aesthetic.

Ready to start building? What's the first piece — tech stack decision, design mockups, or diving straight into code?
user: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +57s 2026-02-07 11:43 GMT+1] Yeaaah that's it. I need your help with brainstorming what angle I should take, how should I talk like and present myself and draft me the sections that should be on the homepage.. I can make it up quickly but I'm burning so much time on figuring out the sections and what should be on the website
[message_id: 1469644823404220499]
assistant: Let me get you unblocked with a concrete framework. First, quick positioning check:

**What's your primary pitch?**
- A) "Tech lead for hire" — you join teams/projects as a senior dev/leader
- B) "Custom web apps" — you build things for clients (agency-style)
- C) "Fractional CTO" — advising + building for startups/businesses
- D) Something else?

**And who exactly are you talking to?**
- Startup founders who need a technical partner?
- Traditional businesses digitizing?
- Other devs/agencies outsourcing overflow?

---

While you think on that, here's a **homepage structure** that works for most angles:

### 1. **Hero** — One clear sentence on what you do + the warm "paper" aesthetic you liked
### 2. **The Problem I Solve** — Show you *get* their pain (messy legacy code, projects stalling, "we need an app but don't know where to start")
### 3. **How I Work** — Your process, not just skills. This builds trust.
### 4. **Proof** — Logos of places you've worked, 1-2 mini case studies, or testimonials
### 5. **Who It's For / Not For** — Qualify your clients (saves you bad-fit inquiries)
### 6. **Blog CTA** — "I write about [topic]" — establishes expertise for the long game
### 7. **Contact** — Low-friction next step

**Voice angle options:**
- **"Calm expert"** — "I've seen this before. Here's how we fix it."
- **"Builder's builder"** — Technical depth, no fluff, for clients who respect craft
- **"Pragmatic partner"** — Business-focused, outcomes over tech jargon

Which direction feels right? Or give me your pitch in your own words and I'll draft the actual copy.
user: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +4m 2026-02-07 11:49 GMT+1] Well, Idk about my primary pitch that's the problem. I can see that I do all of this stuff but it doesn't work that way I guess... I think my website should be focused rn from the angle that I am a builder and I am a freelancer... Does this goes together nicely or not?
[message_id: 1469646126654427301]
assistant: They *can* work together, but you're right to feel the tension. Here's the issue:

**"Freelancer" = available for hire** (transactional)  
**"Builder" = craft-focused creator** (passion/project-driven)

Smushed together, it can sound like *"I build stuff... and also I'll build your stuff for money"* — which is honest but not compelling.

**Better framing: Pick one as your lead, use the other as proof.**

---

**Option A: Lead with "Builder"**
- *Angle:* "I build thoughtful web apps. Sometimes for myself, sometimes for clients."
- *Vibe:* Portfolio-first, projects speak for you, clients come to *you*
- *Homepage hero:* "I build web apps that don't suck" — show your work first

**Option B: Lead with "Freelancer/Partner"**
- *Angle:* "You have a messy technical problem. I fix it."
- *Vibe:* Service-first, client's pain is the star, you are the solution
- *Homepage hero:* "Your project is stuck. I get it moving."

---

**My honest take:** Since you said *"I do all of this stuff"* — you probably want **Option A (Builder)**. It gives you permission to be selective, work on your own stuff, and let clients self-select when they like your style.

The "freelancer" bit doesn't need to be front-and-center — it's implied by "here's how to contact me for projects."

Does that click? Or are you leaning the other way?
user: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +2m 2026-02-07 11:51 GMT+1] I am thinking that maybe I am getting ahead of myself. Right now I have a simple website https://simonmarek.cz but since I dont know what I will do on the future, I dont know if it's worth it to create anything at all... I was thinking that maybe I can only create a simple HTML/CSS website that will serve as a placeholder until I am sure what I want to do - either build stuff for myself or build stuff for others and then I could created it.. What's your opinion?
[message_id: 1469646721725501583]
assistant: You're not getting ahead of yourself — you're being smart. The paralysis of "I don't know what I want" kills more projects than shipping something imperfect.

**My take: Do the simple version.** Here's why:

1. **Your current site exists but is "just something"** — having *anything* intentional is already an upgrade
2. **A clean HTML/CSS placeholder with good design beats a half-baked Next.js monstrosity** every time
3. **You can evolve it** — start minimal, add a blog later, split into pages when you know the structure
4. **It forces clarity** — even writing a simple "About" paragraph will teach you what you actually want to say

**The middle path:**
- Single page, warm aesthetic (that Veil style you liked)
- Sections: Intro → What I do (keep it vague but confident) → Selected work → Contact
- Static HTML/CSS, no build step, host it anywhere

Time investment: One focused afternoon.  
Result: Something you're not embarrassed by, that grows with you.

Want me to draft the copy for that minimal version? Keep it generic enough that it works whether you end up building for yourself, for clients, or both.
user: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +14m 2026-02-07 12:06 GMT+1] Yeah I was thinking that it can be just a heading, subheading, contact info and reference to my socials... Is that enough?
[message_id: 1469650507457888360]
assistant: It's *technically* enough, but it's right on the edge of looking like a parked domain.

**The risk:** If someone's deciding whether to reach out, a heading + contact doesn't give them much to go on. They don't know if you're a designer, backend dev, full-stack, active, retired, etc.

**The sweet spot minimal:**

```
[Your Name]
[One-liner: "Building web things. Sometimes for clients, mostly for curiosity."]
[Contact: email]
[Socials: GitHub, LinkedIn, whatever]
```

That's still 30 seconds to build, but it answers *"is this person relevant to me?"*

**Or even lighter:** Add just **one link** — your GitHub, a project, your LinkedIn, *something* that proves you're real and capable.

Think of it this way: visitors want to know if you're worth their email. Give them *one* signal.

Want me to draft 2-3 versions? Ranging from "ultra-minimal placeholder" to "still simple but slightly more credible"?
user: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +44s 2026-02-07 12:07 GMT+1] I dont care rn if someone want's to reach out.. I just think that my existing website is vague and not relevant anymore.. This website would be just "something" before I build some projects and decide the direction I want to go with
[message_id: 1469650746914898000]
assistant: Perfect. Permission granted to keep it *stupidly simple*.

If it's just a placeholder until you have projects and clarity, don't overthink it. A clean page with your name, a "hey I'm figuring things out" vibe, and where to find you is 100% fine.

**Literally this:**

> **Šimon Marek**  
> Building things for the web.  
> *More soon.*
>
> [GitHub] [LinkedIn] [Email]

That's it. Ship it. Spend your energy on the projects, not the placeholder.

Want me to write the actual HTML/CSS so you can copy-paste it and be done in 10 minutes?
