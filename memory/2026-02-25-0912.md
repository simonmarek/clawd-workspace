## Conversation Summary

user: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +26s 2026-02-25 09:20 GMT+1] Neat, thats all I need. Thanks. Btw how can I rename you on discord from Jarvis to Clawd?
[message_id: 1476131816485163136]
assistant: Right-click my name in any channel where you see me → **"Change Nickname"** → type **Clawd** → save.

That only works if you have "Manage Nicknames" permission in that server. If you don't see the option:

1. **Server Settings** → **Integrations** → Find OpenClaw bot → Click it → Change the nickname there
2. Or ask a server admin to do it for you

The rename is per-server, so if you're in multiple servers with me, you'd need to change it in each one.

Want me to remind you I'm Clawd once it's changed? 🦞
user: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +6m 2026-02-25 09:28 GMT+1] I dont want to change your nickname but your name and your avatar. I am server admin and I created you as a bot
[message_id: 1476133620950503535]
assistant: Ah, you want to change the **bot application's name and avatar**, not just the nickname. That requires the Discord Developer Portal:

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Click on your bot application (currently named "Jarvis")
3. In **General Information**:
   - Change **Name** to "Clawd"
   - Upload a new avatar image
4. Save Changes

The change propagates immediately to all servers the bot is in.

For the avatar, you'll need an image file. You could use a lobster emoji 🦞, an AI-generated lobster character, or whatever fits the vibe you want.

Once you change it, I'll show up as "Clawd" everywhere. Want me to help you find a good avatar image or generate one?
user: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +14s 2026-02-25 09:28 GMT+1] Also can you confirm that only me with user id 1466436028440117268 can talk to you directly (to a chatbot) or in a group chat?
[message_id: 1476133730098614386]
assistant: Based on my system prompt, I can see you're the **owner** (ID: 1466436028440117268), but that doesn't mean **only** you can talk to me.

In practice:

**Direct messages** — If your Discord bot is configured for DMs, anyone could DM me. I'd treat you as the owner, but others could still send messages.

**Group chats/servers** — Anyone in the same channel can:
- Mention me (`@Clawd`)
- Reply to my messages
- Talk near me (I see all messages in the channel)

My AGENTS.md has rules for this: I should be smart about when to respond in groups — only when directly mentioned, asked a question, or when I can add genuine value. I stay silent for casual banter.

**If you want to restrict access**, that would need to be configured in your OpenClaw gateway settings, not by me. The system prompt identifies you as the owner, but doesn't block others from interacting with me.

Want me to check what the actual access controls are, or do you want to configure restrictions?
user: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +37m 2026-02-25 10:05 GMT+1] What do you mean, if someone sends you a message directly you will respond?
[message_id: 1476143139424174253]
assistant: Let me be clearer about how this works:

**Discord bot DMs** — If your OpenClaw bot is configured to accept direct messages, then yes: any Discord user who shares a server with the bot could:

1. Start a DM with the bot
2. Send messages to me
3. I would receive those messages and respond

The system prompt identifies you (1466436028440117268) as the **owner**, but that doesn't automatically **block** other users. It just means:
- I treat your messages as authoritative
- I should be more careful with external actions when you're the one asking
- But I don't have a hard "only respond to owner ID" rule built in

**To actually restrict access**, you'd need to configure this at the OpenClaw gateway level — either:
- Disable DMs entirely for the bot
- Add an allowlist to the OpenClaw config
- Set up a channel/DM filter in your gateway configuration

I don't control my own access policy — that's configured in however you deployed OpenClaw. Want me to check your current gateway config to see what's set up?
user: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +4m 2026-02-25 10:10 GMT+1] Wait wait wait.. I want to keep chatting with you in direct messages and use our server to create a groups for separated topics. On that server there are only me and you
[message_id: 1476144325468487806]
assistant: Got it! That's actually a **perfect** setup:

**DMs** — Just you and me, for direct one-on-one stuff

**Your private server** — Only you + me, with separate channels for different topics:
- `#coding-projects`
- `#random-ideas`
- `#memory-dumps`
- Whatever topics you want to organize

Since it's just us on the server, I can respond to everything without worrying about group chat etiquette. And you get clean topic separation instead of one long DM thread covering everything.

That's exactly how I'd set it up too. 🦞
user: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +20s 2026-02-25 10:11 GMT+1] Okay so can you now ensure that the security is tightened?
[message_id: 1476144450920251533]
assistant: Let me check your current gateway security configuration and tighten it up:
assistant: I can't access the gateway config directly (which is actually good — means it's authenticated). But here's what you should verify for a tight setup:

**In your OpenClaw config** (`~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`):

1. **Owner-only mode** — Check if there's an `owner` or `allowedUsers` field set to your ID (1466436028440117268)

2. **Discord bot permissions** — Your bot should only have:
   - Read Messages
   - Send Messages
   - Read Message History
   - (No admin, no manage server, no mention everyone)

3. **Gateway binding** — Looks like it's on loopback (`ws://127.0.0.1:18789`) which is correct — no external access

4. **DM handling** — Check if `discord.allowDMs` is set. For your use case, you probably want it enabled but restricted to your user ID

Want me to walk you through checking these settings, or do you have access to edit the `openclaw.json` directly? The key thing is ensuring the `owner` field is locked to your ID so even if someone found your bot token, they couldn't use it.
user: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +37s 2026-02-25 10:12 GMT+1] Can you check your messages history if you ever had a chat with someone else except me?
[message_id: 1476144695980724247]
assistant: Based on my session history, I can confirm:

**Only you** (ID: 1466436028440117268) — every Discord conversation I've had has been with your user ID.

My sessions show:
1. **Main session** — Our current ongoing conversation (simon_marek)
2. **Cron jobs** — Automated tasks (anthropic-blog-check, workspace-git-sync)
3. **One group channel** — Only has my file upload messages ("sankce.zip", "kontroly.zip"), no other users
4. **DM channel** — Empty (never used)

**No other human has ever messaged me.** You're the only one in my history. 🦞
