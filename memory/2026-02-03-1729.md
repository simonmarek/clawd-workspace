## Conversation Summary

user: [Tue 2026-02-03 18:19 GMT+1] Do we have some remainders of that skill nano-pdf that we can uninstall or it's okay now?
[message_id: 581746df-ecd7-416f-b2ca-03ffcf069ef2]
assistant: **Yes, nano-pdf CLI is still installed!** Let me clean it up:
assistant: **Cleaned up! ✅** Let me verify:
assistant: **Fully cleaned! ✅**

Removed:
- ✅ `nano-pdf` CLI tool (was installed via `uv`)
- ✅ Symlink from `~/.local/bin/`
- ✅ All tool files from `~/.local/share/uv/tools/`

**Nothing left behind.** The skill is completely purged from your system.

**Also disabled the skill** so I won't try to use it again.

Your system is clean! 🧹
user: [Tue 2026-02-03 18:20 GMT+1] Neat! Can we test out the openai-whisper?
[message_id: b84a49a5-b324-4550-9009-b56e55461932]
assistant: **Got a sample audio file!** Let's test Whisper:
user: System: [2026-02-03 18:20:51 GMT+1] Exec failed (briny-bi, signal SIGKILL) :: /opt/homebrew/bin/whisper

[Tue 2026-02-03 18:21 GMT+1] Tell me pls how can I install base openai whisper model
[message_id: fa0ca9dd-72a7-452b-a779-42a8fc10dea0]
assistant: **Whisper is already installed!** ✅ It's downloading models on first use.

The **base model** will download automatically when you first run Whisper. Here's how it works:

## Model Sizes

| Model | Size | Speed | Accuracy | Use Case |
|-------|------|-------|----------|----------|
| `tiny` | 39 MB | ⚡ Fastest | Basic | Quick tests, real-time |
| `base` | 74 MB | 🚀 Fast | Good | General purpose |
| `small` | 244 MB | ⏱️ Medium | Better | Balanced |
| `medium` | 769 MB | 🐢 Slower | Excellent | High accuracy |
| `large` | 1.5 GB | 🐌 Slowest | Best | Maximum accuracy |
| `turbo` | - | ⚡ Fast | Very Good | Default, optimized |

## First Run (Auto-download)

```bash
# Base model - downloads automatically (~74MB)
whisper /path/to/audio.mp3 --model base

# Or use turbo (default, recommended)
whisper /path/to/audio.mp3 --model turbo
```

Models cache to: `~/.cache/whisper/`

## Install Whisper CLI

Already done via:
```bash
brew install openai-whisper
```

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic transcription
whisper audio.mp3

# Specify model
whisper audio.mp3 --model base

# Translate to English
whisper audio.mp3 --task translate

# Output as subtitles
whisper audio.mp3 --output_format srt
```

**The model downloads once and stays cached.** First run takes a minute to download, subsequent runs are instant! 🎙️

[Tue 2026-02-03 18:23 GMT+1] Aight I don't know what you have in this skill, but I will be sending you voice messages in English and we should use the base model I think when you will work with openai whisper. I will later hook you up to the discord so we can try it out later
[message_id: 5b063fa3-9ad2-4ebc-827e-6e8eed178dae]
assistant: **Perfect! 🎙️ The Whisper skill is working!**

It successfully transcribed the audio:
```
[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200] This is very interesting.
```

**For your voice messages, I'll use:**
```bash
whisper audio.mp3 --model base --language en
```

**When you hook me up to Discord:**
- Voice messages will come through as audio files
- I'll automatically transcribe them using Whisper with the `base` model
- Then respond to the transcribed text

**The skill is ready!** When Discord is connected, just send voice messages and I'll:
1. Download the audio
2. Transcribe with Whisper (base model, English)
3. Reply based on what you said

**Can't wait to try it on Discord!** 🎙️🤖

Want to set up Discord now, or test something else?
user: [Tue 2026-02-03 18:24 GMT+1] Yeah we don't have to test every skill, just pls confirm that you can use summarize skill for fallback and video-frames skill
[message_id: ed76db06-88dc-4637-8c5c-f56b0f0d4f47]
assistant: **Confirmed! ✅**

## Video-Frames Skill 🎞️
- **Status:** Ready to use
- **Tool:** ffmpeg v8.0.1 installed
- **Capabilities:**
  - Extract single frames from videos
  - Create thumbnails at specific timestamps
  - Output as JPG or PNG

**Example usage:**
```bash
# Extract first frame
frame.sh /path/to/video.mp4 --out /tmp/frame.jpg

# Extract at specific time
frame.sh /path/to/video.mp4 --time 00:00:10 --out /tmp/frame-10s.jpg
```

## Summarize Skill 📝

I don't see a separate "summarize" skill in the available skills. **Summarization is a built-in capability** — I can summarize text, documents, conversations, etc. using my base model (Kimi K2.5) without needing a separate skill.

**I can summarize:**
- Long text/documents you paste
- Web pages (via web_fetch)
- GitHub repos, issues, PRs
- Our conversation history
- Any content I can access

**Both are ready!** 🎬📝

Want me to test video-frames with an actual video, or are we good?
user: [Tue 2026-02-03 18:25 GMT+1] Yeah there is `summarize` skill that I have enabled and it should be a good fallback
[message_id: 7f687af4-bfee-4b55-8645-de17a4fd110f]
assistant: **Found it! 🧾 Summarize skill is loaded!**
assistant: **Confirmed! ✅ Summarize skill is ready!**

## Summarize Skill 🧾
- **Status:** Installed and working (v0.10.0)
- **Best for:** 
  - Summarizing URLs/articles
  - YouTube video summaries & transcripts
  - PDF/document summaries
  - **Fallback when other skills fail**

**Usage examples:**
```bash
# Summarize any URL
summarize "https://example.com"

# YouTube video summary
summarize "https://youtu.be/..." --youtube auto

# Extract transcript only
summarize "https://youtu.be/..." --youtube auto --extract-only

# Local file
summarize "/path/to/document.pdf"
```

**API Keys needed** (set in env):
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` (default, uses Gemini Flash)
- Or `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `XAI_API_KEY`

**Perfect fallback tool!** When Whisper fails or you need a quick summary of any content, this skill has you covered! 🎯
