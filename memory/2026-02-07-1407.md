assistant: Hey Simon. Jarvis here — ready when you are. What's on your mind today?
user: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +3s 2026-02-07 14:28 GMT+1] Jo Jarvis you remember when we done https://github.com/simonmarek/coi-blacklist-extension ?
[message_id: 1469686297730875545]
assistant: Don't see anything in my notes about that project. Let me pull it up — what were we working on?
user: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +2m 2026-02-07 14:30 GMT+1] Yeah it was with different Jarvis if I recall correctly. Doesn't matter. We had also one more idea that was about creating ARES extension for easily fetching data about a company. Can we brainstorm on that? Can you verify that it's a still good idea, we have no competition and figure out how it should work in order to be as beneficial to the user as possible?
[message_id: 1469686861097210109]
assistant: Let me research the landscape first — ARES, existing solutions, and what would actually make this useful.
assistant: Alright, here's what I found and my take on this:

## The Landscape

**Existing solutions:**
- **Dáváme** has a Pipedrive add-on that auto-fills company data when you enter an IČO — it's free and pretty slick
- **PFC Group** has something similar for Zoho CRM
- **No standalone browser extension** for general ARES lookups exists
- People currently use: vyhledavace.cz, firmy.cz, kurzy.cz, or the official (clunky) ARES website

## Is it still a good idea?

**Yes, but with the right angle.** The CRM integrations are tied to specific platforms. A general-purpose browser extension would fill a gap — quick lookups without leaving your current page.

## How to make it actually useful

**Core UX:**
- **Highlight any 8-digit number** → right-click → "Look up in ARES" (like dictionary extensions)
- **Auto-detect IČO patterns** on pages (emails, PDFs, invoices) and add subtle inline previews
- **Keyboard shortcut** for quick lookup popup

**Data to show:**
- Company name, address, legal form
- Registration date, status (active/liquidated)
- VAT payer status (critical for B2B)
- Possibly linked persons (statutory representatives)

**Smart features:**
- **Batch mode**: paste multiple IČOs, get a CSV export
- **History**: recently looked up companies
- **Integration hooks**: copy as formatted text for emails/invoices

**Differentiation from existing tools:**
- Universal (works everywhere, not just in CRMs)
- Speed — no page navigation, instant overlay
- Export options

Worth building? I'd say yes — the CRM plugins prove demand, and there's no general-purpose solution yet. Want me to sketch out a technical approach or MVP scope?
user: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +2m 2026-02-07 14:33 GMT+1] I like that core UX except keyboard shortcut as most of the potential users would be bad with using shortcuts. Can you research how we can get those data to show? Remember it would run in the client
[message_id: 1469687547432271984]
assistant: Alright, here's the technical breakdown:

## The API

**New REST API** (launched 2023, old XML deprecated):
```
GET https://ares.gov.cz/ekonomicke-subjekty-v-be/rest/ekonomicke-subjekty/{ICO}
```

**Example:**
```
https://ares.gov.cz/ekonomicke-subjekty-v-be/rest/ekonomicke-subjekty/27604977
(Google Czech Republic)
```

## What Data You Get (JSON)

From researching the schema, the key fields available:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `obchodniJmeno` | Company name |
| `sidlo` | Address object (street, house number, city, ZIP) |
| `pravniForma` | Legal form (s.r.o., a.s., etc.) |
| `ico` | IČO |
| `dic` | DIČ (VAT number) |
| `datumVzniku` | Registration date |
| `stav` | Status (active, liquidated, etc.) |
| `czNace` | Industry classification codes |
| `statutarniOrgan` | Statutory representatives (directors) |

## Rate Limits & Constraints

- **500 requests/minute** max (they'll block you if you exceed this)
- **No API key required** — it's public open data
- **Respect the limits**: Don't hammer it, cache results

## CORS / Browser Extension Reality Check

Here's the catch: **The API may not have CORS headers** for direct browser fetch from content scripts. Your options:

1. **Background service worker** (Manifest V3) makes the API calls — this bypasses CORS issues
2. Content script detects IČO → sends message to background → background fetches → returns data → content script shows overlay

This is the standard pattern for browser extensions calling external APIs.

## Search Endpoint (Optional)

There's also a POST endpoint for searching by name:
```
POST https://ares.gov.cz/ekonomicke-subjekty-v-be/rest/ekonomicke-subjekty/vyhledat
```
With filter body like `{"obchodniJmeno": "some company name"}`

Want me to sketch out the extension architecture with message passing between content script and background worker?
user: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +1m 2026-02-07 14:37 GMT+1] We can also check if they are VAT payer with this endpoint?
[message_id: 1469688462465568769]
assistant: Yes — but it's a separate SOAP service, not the ARES REST API.

## VAT Payer Status Check

The ARES API gives you the DIČ (CZ+IC), but to verify if they're actually a **VAT payer (plátce DPH)**, you need to hit a different endpoint:

```
http://adisrws.mfcr.cz/adistc/axis2/services/rozhraniCRPDPH.rozhraniCRPDPHSOAP?wsdl
```

**It's a SOAP service**, not REST/JSON. The method is `getStatusNespolehlivyPlatce` with the DIČ as parameter.

It returns:
- **Status**: Is the entity a VAT payer?
- **Unreliable payer flag** (nespolehlivý plátce) — critical for B2B verification
- **Published bank accounts** for the VAT payer

## The Reality for Browser Extension

**Option 1: SOAP in Extension**
- Possible but messy — you'd need to construct SOAP envelopes in JS
- CORS might be an issue since it's an older government service

**Option 2: Proxy/Backend**
- Your extension calls your own lightweight API that wraps the SOAP service
- More reliable, but adds infrastructure

**Option 3: Just Show DIČ**
- Get DIČ from ARES (it's in the response: `"dic": "CZ12345678"`)
- Display it with a link to the official VAT register check page
- Let users verify manually if needed

## Recommendation

For an MVP: **Go with Option 3**. 

The DIČ alone tells you a lot — if ARES returns a `dic` field, the company is registered for tax. Most users just need to know "do they have a VAT number?" which the presence of `dic` confirms.

Add a small "Verify VAT status" link that opens:
```
https://adisspr.mfcr.cz/adistc/adis/idpr_pub/dpr_info/ws_spdph.faces
```

Want to build the full VAT check later? That's a nice premium feature.
user: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +5m 2026-02-07 14:44 GMT+1] What would be the use case for people to use this extension? What problem would it solve?
[message_id: 1469690224538943682]
assistant: Good question — let's get concrete about who actually needs this and why they'd install it.

## Target Users

**Primary: Small business owners, freelancers, accountants**
- You get an invoice with just an IČO — who is this? Are they legit?
- Someone emails you a quote — verify the company exists before you pay
- Filling out a contract — need correct company name and address

**Secondary: B2B sales, procurement, recruiters**
- Researching prospects before a call
- Verifying supplier details
- Background checks on companies

## The Problem (Current Reality)

You see an 8-digit number (IČO) in:
- An email
- A PDF invoice  
- A website
- A contract

**Current workflow:**
1. Select and copy the IČO
2. Open new tab
3. Go to `ares.gov.cz` or `vyhledavace.cz`
4. Paste, wait, click through results
5. Copy company name/address back to where you need it

**That's 30-60 seconds of friction** for something you do dozens of times per week.

## What Your Extension Solves

**"IČO → Company Info in 1 second"**

- **Highlight any 8-digit number** → right-click → instant popup with company name, address, status
- **Auto-detect IČOs** on pages → inline preview (like hover cards)
- **No tab switching** — information appears where you're already working
- **Copy-ready** — formatted address, company name for pasting into your invoice/CRM

## Concrete Use Cases

| Scenario | Without Extension | With Extension |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Receiving invoice from new vendor | Copy IČO, open ARES, search, verify they exist | Highlight IČO, right-click, see company info instantly |
| Writing contract | Copy-paste from email, hope it's correct | Look up in sidebar, copy official name from ARES |
| Prospect research | Open multiple tabs to check each company | Hover over IČO on their website, see basic info |
| VAT verification | Manual check on MFCR website | See DIČ presence + link to verify |

## The Core Value Prop

**"Don't leave your workflow to look up company data."**

In Czech business life, IČOs are everywhere. Your extension turns them into **rich, interactive tokens** — hover, see, done.

Does this resonate with how you'd use it? Or is there a specific workflow you had in mind?
user: [Discord simon_marek user id:1466436028440117268 +1m 2026-02-07 14:45 GMT+1] I'm still not sure about the usefulness of this extension
[message_id: 1469690662327943344]
assistant: Fair. Let's be real about this.

## Honest Assessment

**The weaknesses:**

1. **How often do you *really* look up IČOs while browsing?** Most people do this in batches when processing invoices — not scattered throughout the day. A web app might be just as good as a browser extension.

2. **Existing solutions are "good enough"** — vyhledavace.cz, firmy.cz, kurzy.cz. They're one search away and people already know them.

3. **CRM integrations (Dáváme, PFC) solve the real pain point** — automatic data entry where people actually need it. A standalone extension is just... slightly faster manual lookup.

4. **Chrome extensions have friction** — people need to install it, give permissions, keep it updated. Is saving 20 seconds worth that?

## When it *would* make sense:

- If you could integrate with **specific workflows** (accounting software, email clients) — but that's a much bigger project
- If you added **unique data** (blacklist checks, financial health, court records) — but that's harder to get
- If you made it a **side feature** of something bigger (like your coi-blacklist-extension)

## Alternative to consider:

A simple **web app** that:
- Has a clean search interface
- Remembers your recent lookups
- Can export to CSV
- Maybe has a bookmarklet for quick access

Lower friction to build, easier to maintain, same core utility.

**Bottom line:** If you're not feeling it, trust that instinct. The CRM plugins proved there's demand for *integrated* company data, but a standalone lookup tool might just be reinventing vyhledavace.cz with a Chrome wrapper.

What's making you hesitate? Is it the idea itself, or just not the right time/project?
